            <p class="quote-text">The author Jessica Helfand, starts the passage by expressing to her readers about how a newly engaged form of any critical practice is necessary if it does not include exploring one’s originality. She speaks about how autonomy in graphic design is vital to sustain a designer’s true identity. In the genesis of this article, Konstantin Stanislavski, a theatre practitioner, compares modern theatre by introducing a new system of training in which the actor would draw on his or her own emotions to truly understand their original character. He states “We protested against the old manner of acting and against theatricality, against artificial pathos and declamation,” in order to bring about a revolution in the field of acting. In contrast to the loud, overdramatic fashion, a character once understood could be portrayed much more subtly encompassing all his/her traits. This pedagogical system developed by Konstantin was titled ‘method training’ which was laster used to train designers. </p>
